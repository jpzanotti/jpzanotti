- Hi, I’m @jpzanotti
- I mainly program to help me solve mathematical problems.
- I use Python when I'm feeling lazy and time or space isn't critical, and I turn to the C language otherwise.
- I have some very basic knowledge of JavaScript, which has been helpful in adding some interactivity to my online courses.
- I'm not at all familiar with the Github environment (I rarely need to do collaborative development work), but I'll look into it if I can find some time in my schedule.
jpzanotti/jpzanotti is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
